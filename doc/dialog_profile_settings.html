<h2 align=center>Profile Settings Dialog</h2>
<p>
This dialog is entered from the main dialog by clicking the
<b>Edit</b> or <b>Add</b> button.
</p>
<table border frame=box><tr>
<td valign=top>
<h4>approved helptext</h4>

<p>You may change the <b>Profile Name</b> at any time. Names may contain
letters, digits, underscore, dash, and dot. The first character must be a letter
or digit. The <b>Description</b> is optional.</p>

<p>Additionally, you may set dedicated scripts to execute at a given time during
profile switching.  First, the switch process collects data. It compares
resources and determines what to change. This data is listed for confirmation in
the Confirm Switch pop-up.  Then the switch will be executed:<br>
- execute <b>Prestop script</b> from old profile<br>
- stop some services<br>
- execute <b>Poststop script</b> from old profile<br>
- change configuration files<br>
- execute <b>Prestart script</b> from new profile<br>
- start some services<br>
- execute <b>Poststart script</b> from new profile<br>
</p>

<p><b>Security Warning:</b><br>
These scripts are executed as the user root. Make sure no users can change or
even read them without authorization.  For YaST to set the appropriate file
permissions, check the box at the bottom of the dialog.</p>

<h3 align=left>General information</h3>
In this dialog the user can alter some profile specific data.

<h3 align=left>Getting information</h3>
The name of the profile is already known if we came here via Edit. If we came
here via Add then leave the name field empty or suggest a new name. It may only
contain the characters [a-zA-Z0-9_-.] and must start with [a-zA-Z0-9].<br>
The description and script paths can be queried calling <code><a
href="/usr/share/doc/packages/scpm/api/html/classSCPM.html#a16">SCPM::Get</a> </code> comand.<br>
The <b>Set file permissions...</b> check box is a global option and not a
property of the profile. YaST2 has to store this value somewhere like the 'close
progress popup automatically' information.

<h3 align=left>Actions to perform</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Name</b></li>
In this line edit widget the profile name is shown. This field is
changeable. The profile name may not contain all
characters. Please check the name and complain somehow if it<br>
- does contain anythings else then [a-zA-Z0-9_-.]<br>
- starts with anything else then [a-zA-Z0-9]<br>
- is empty</li>
<li><b>Description</b></li>
This text box holds the description of the profile, if existent. This
text is changeable. The description is optional.
<li><b>Pre|Post Start|Stop Script</b></li>
Those line edit fields hold the queried script paths (if any). They
are changeable. If YaST2 can provide a 'choose file' popup, then feel free to
add buttons behind the text fields which raise such a popup. All scripts are
optional.
<li><b>Set file permissions of all scripts secure</b></li>
This is a global option and not a property of the profile. Please store that
value somewhere appropriate.</li>
<li><b>Back</b></li>
Just go back to the <a href="dialog_main.html">main dialog</a>,
dropping all changes.
<li><b>Ok</b></li>
In case the user changed the profile's name, call <code> <a
href="/usr/share/doc/packages/scpm/api/html/callSCPM.html#a10">SCPM::Rename</a></code> to rename the profile
accordingly. If we came here via Add then use <code><a
href="/usr/share/doc/packages/scpm/api/html/classSCPM.html#a6">SCPM::Add</a> </code> resp. <code><a
href="/usr/share/doc/packages/scpm/api/html/classSCPM.html#a7">SCPM::Copy</a></code> with the information
collected in <a href="popup_add_profile.html">Add new Profile</a>. When the
suboption <b>Make the added profile...</b> was checked the use
the optional <var>auto_switch</var> parameter of <code>SCPM:Add</code>
to make the new profile also the active one.<br>
In case the user changed the description and/or at
least one of the script paths, write the changes to the profile using
the corresponding <code><a href="/usr/share/doc/packages/scpm/api/html/classSCPM.html#a15">SCPM::Set</a>
</code> command.<br>
If <b>Set file permissions of all scripts secure</b> is checked then chmod 700
these scripts.<br>
Afterwards, go back to the <a href="dialog_main.html">main dialog</a>.
</ul>
