<h2 align="center"> General Information </h2>

<h4> Terminology </h4>
<ul>
<li> A <b>resource</b> is a file, a service or what else has to be changed when
we switch between different profiles. Files are changed, created or deleted.
Services are started or stopped and inserted to or removed from a runlevel.
There are <b>resourec sets</b> from which the user may choose one when
configuring SCPM.
</li>
<li> <b>Configuration</b> always means the configuration of the computer. If we
speak of the configuration of SCPM itself, we always write "SCPM configuration".
</li>
<li> A <b>profile</b> is a set of resources. It may be the whole configuration
or just a part of it, e.g. networking, mail and printing. From the sight of
YaST2 every profile contains the same resources. Anything enhanced has to be
done manually for now. </li>
<li> A profile is called <b>active</b> after you switched to it.
</li></ul>

<h4>Levels</h4>
There are 3 different levels when working with SCPM:
<ul>
<li> The topmost and mostly used level is to switch between already configured
profiles. We call this level <b>switch level</b>. </li>
<li> The level below is to create, delete or rename a profile and of course to
do all the changes to the configuration in a profile. But the change of the
configuration is job of other YaST2 modules. We call this level <b>profile
management level</b>. </li>
<li> The base level is to choose which resources are treated by SCPM. The user
may choose of a predefined resource set or create a individual one. This level
we call <b>resource management level</b>. </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="workflow">Workflow</a></h4>

<p>The SCPM module differs from most other YaST2 modules. It is not just an
configuration workflow, where you configure a service which is used at another
place. In this module the user works with SCPM. Therefore it makes no sense jst
to collect data, which will be written at the very end. All actions will be
performed nearly immediately. There is just a <b>Close</b> button at the main
dialog which triggers no additionally action.</p>

<p>When the module starts it will always show the dialog <a href="dialog_main.html">System Configuration Profile Management</a>. This the
main dialog to deal with SCPM. All other dialogs are 'expert' dialogs from which
we return to the main dialog. These are:
</p><ul>
<li> The dialog <a href="dialog_options.html">SCPM Options</a> configures SCPM
itself. The user must go there when he uses SCPM the first time. But we don't go
there automatically. Insted we show the user a popup <a href="popup_introduction.html">Introduction</a> to tell him what to to.
</li><li> The dialog <a href="dialog_profile_settings.html">Special Profile
Settings</a> will be used to <b>Add</b> or <b>Edit</b> profiles. To <b>Add</b> a
profile the popup <a href="popup_add_profile.html">Add new Profile</a> has to be
shown first.
</li><li> When switching to another profile we will show the dialog <a href="dialog_switch.html">Confirm Switch</a>. This should really be a dialog
and not just a popup, because there sometimes may be a lot of changes to be
confirmed. Before and after this dialog we show the popup <a href="popup_progress.html">Progess</a>.
</li></ul>
