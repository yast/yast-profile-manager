<h3 align=left>General information</h3>
<p>This window has informational purpose only. It is mainly used in
the switch process to show the user what's going on.
The <b>Close</b> button is initially disabled and gets enabled when
the apropriate SCPM function retured.</p>

<h3 align=left>Getting information</h3>
<p>The information the
popup shows directly come from SCPM, the two stream objects you passed
to the <a href="API/classSCPM.html#a0">constructor</a> are used for
it. The first stream object is the one, the messages get written to.
Everything that comes on this object should be written in the rich
text widget. The second stream object will get exactly 100 hash marks
while the action is performed. You can use this information to display
the progress bar.

<h3 align=left>Actions to perform</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Close progress popups automatically</b></li>
In case this check box is set, the popup should get auto closed when
the action is performed.
NOTE: this information is saved
to /var/lib/YaST2/scpm.ycp
<li><b>Close</b></li>
Closes the popup.
</ul>
